[^*]: ... Or how I've been struggling to understand the well-designed ideas behind the Erlang/OTP, Elixir, and other BEAM languages and systems, while I still have a very hard time to learn "object-oriented" programming languages

^ Good afternoon, everybody. My name is Kenji Rikitake. I'm originally from Tokyo, Japan, and I'm going to talk about the BEAM Programming Paradigm.

---

# Programming paradigm?
# What is that?
# Is it about a programming *paradise*?

^ When I first heard the phrase called "programming paradigm", I was perplexed. I didn't grasp the core meaning of the word "paradigm" at that time. All I knew then was there's no paradise on programming.

---

# Paradigm = pattern + worldview [^1]

* A typical example or pattern of something; a model
* A worldview underlying the theories and methodology of a particular scientific subject

[^1]: New Oxford American Dictionary, macOS 10.14.4

^ I later learned that the word paradigm was about a pattern, and a worldview represented by the underlying theories and methodology of a scientific subject.

# Programming Paradigm in Wikipedia

> Programming paradigms are a way to classify programming languages based on their features.
-- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_paradigm)

^ In Wikipedia, there is a definition of programming paradigms, quote: programming paradigms are a way to classify programming languages based on their features. So, simply speaking, the word paradigm means the features, for programming.

# Languages -> Paradigms -> Concepts

* Many languages belong to one paradigm
* A paradigm may have many concepts

## [fit] Peter Van Roy states there are 27 different programming paradigms [^2]

[^2]: Peter Van Roy: [Programming Paradigms for Dummies: What Every Programmer Should Know](https://www.info.ucl.ac.be/~pvr/paradigms.html), 2009, Section 2

^ Peter Van Roy, the first keynote speaker of this conference, has published a comprehensive reference for the programming paradigms, called Programming Paradigms for Dummies, publicly available on the web. In the document, he shows that many languages belongs to the same paradigm, and a paradigm may have many concepts.

# Thanks, Joe.

You taught me how to program in the principle of *lagom 채r b채st*.

You helped me finding out a new hope for programming, after I got lost in the C header files of ISC BIND 9.4.2 in 2007.

I'm impressed by your hospitality, as well as your creative mind.

We will remember you.

^ And I'd like to thank Joe Armstrong, the creator of Erlang, who taught me lagom 채r b채st for programming, and helped me to get out of the C code of ISC BIND 9 through his Programming Erlang 1st Edition book in 2008. I was very much impressed by his hospitality, as well as his creative mind. I'm sure we'll all remember him.
