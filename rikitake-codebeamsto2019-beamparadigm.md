# [fit] The BEAM Programming Paradigm [^*]

[^*]: ... Or how I've been struggling to understand the well-designed ideas behind the Erlang/OTP, Elixir, and other BEAM languages and systems, while I still have a very hard time to learn "object-oriented" programming languages

# Thanks, Joe.

You taught me how to program in the principle of *lagom 채r b채st*.

You helped me finding out a new hope for programming, after I got lost in the C header files of ISC BIND 9.4.2 in 2007.

I'm impressed by your hospitality, as well as your creative mind.

We will remember you.

^ And I'd like to thank Joe Armstrong, the creator of Erlang, who taught me lagom 채r b채st for programming, and helped me to get out of the C code of ISC BIND 9 through his Programming Erlang 1st Edition book in 2008. I was very much impressed by his hospitality, as well as his creative mind. I'm sure we'll all remember him.
